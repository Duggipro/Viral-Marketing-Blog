  <p>The Psychology Behind Viral Marketing</p>

<div class="container">
  <h2>Is Virality Random?</h2>
  <p>Ever wondered why some videos or campaigns blow up while others get ignored? Virality isn’t luck—it’s science. Leading thinkers like Jonah Berger, Malcolm Gladwell, and Seth Godin have uncovered patterns behind how ideas spread and why people share.</p>

  <h2>The STEPPS Framework</h2>
  <p>Jonah Berger’s <strong>STEPPS</strong> model outlines six elements that drive sharing:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Social Currency:</strong> We share things that make us look good.</li>
    <li><strong>Triggers:</strong> “Top of mind means tip of tongue.”</li>
    <li><strong>Emotion:</strong> High-arousal feelings like awe or amusement encourage sharing.</li>
    <li><strong>Public:</strong> Observable actions are easier to imitate.</li>
    <li><strong>Practical Value:</strong> Useful content gets shared more often.</li>
    <li><strong>Stories:</strong> Narrative content is easier to remember and pass on.</li>
  </ul>

  <blockquote>
    “People don’t just share facts, they share feelings and stories.” – Jonah Berger
  </blockquote>

  <h2>Social Currency & Inner Remarkability</h2>
  <p>People talk about things that make them appear smart, trendy, or unique. Brands that offer exclusivity, surprise, or wow-factor get shared more. Think: Apple's “Shot on iPhone” or limited-time product drops.</p>

  <h2>Triggers That Keep Brands Top-of-Mind</h2>
  <p>Triggers connect a brand to a specific time or activity—like Budweiser and sports, or coffee and KitKats. The more often a trigger appears in someone's life, the more they think and talk about the associated brand.</p>

  <h2>Gamification & Bragging Rights</h2>
  <p>Game mechanics like points and badges encourage users to share their progress. Achievements become status symbols. Think of Spotify Wrapped or Duolingo streaks—users can’t resist showing off!</p>

  <h2>Emotion Drives Action</h2>
  <p>Emotional intensity plays a key role in virality. Content that stirs strong feelings—whether it’s laughter, awe, anger, or inspiration—is far more likely to be shared.</p>

  <h2>Influencers, Mavens & Connectors</h2>
  <p>According to Malcolm Gladwell’s “Tipping Point,” social epidemics often rely on a few key people: <strong>Connectors</strong> (wide social circles), <strong>Mavens</strong> (knowledge sharers), and <strong>Salespeople</strong> (charismatic persuaders).</p>

  <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
  <p>Viral marketing isn’t just about luck—it’s about structure. Use emotion, storytelling, and visibility to create something people want to talk about. When your content is both shareable and meaningful, it becomes contagious.</p>
